# Contributing to dpymenus
I'm open to all input and help! Please open an issue to discuss any changes to the codebase beforehand. This includes
bugs, general refactoring, performance changes, documentation updates, new examples, etc.

## Pull Requests
Please base your code on the `next` branch.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/robertwayne/dpymenus/issues)
Please include, when you can:
- A quick summary
- Specific steps to reproduce
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
* Use whitespace to break up dense code (if/else, try/catch).
* All library code should be type annotated. Examples should not.
* All code will be formatted by `black` when merged.

## License
By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the MIT License.
